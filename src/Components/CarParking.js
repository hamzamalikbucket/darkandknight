            </div>
              <h1 className='py-3'>Introduction</h1>
              <p>Car parking security is vital in maintaining order, safety, and efficiency in busy urban areas. To enhance security measures, we have adopted Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) in Manchester, London, Blackburn, and Leeds. This article will explore the significance of ANPR in car parking security, its implementation in different cities, and its benefits to these locations.</p>
              <h1>What is ANPR?</h1>
